### :fire: Highlight
 - The program depends on different states, such as Mario's walking, jumping, walking and falling states, and switches between different states according to different situations.
 - Background scrolling principle: In fact, the background image moves backward while Mario's position on the screen remains unchanged.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Install 

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yubo97/SuperMario.git

3. Run mario_level_1.py file.
